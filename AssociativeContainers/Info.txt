1. Associative containers place their elements based on the element itself
2. For example, it's not possible to add an element at the back or front in an associative container
3. The elements are added in a way that makes it possible to find the element without the need to scan the entire container

Two main categories-
	1. Ordered- These containers are based on trees. These
containers use a tree for storing their elements. They require that the elements are
ordered by the less than operator (<). The functions for adding, deleting, and
finding elements are all O(log n) in the tree-based containers. The containers are
named std::set, std::map, std::multiset, and std::multimap.
	2. Unordered- These containers are based on hash tables.
These containers uses a hash table for storing their elements.The
functions for adding, deleting, and finding elements are all O(1) in the hash tablebased containers. The containers are named std::unordered_set,
std::unordered_map, std::unordered_multiset, and
std::unordered_multimap.
