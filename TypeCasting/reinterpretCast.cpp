/*
 * Used to convert a pointer of some data type into a pointer of another data type, even if the the data types before and after conversion are different
 * It does not check if the pointer type and data pointed by the pointer is same or not.
 * It doesnâ€™t have any return type. It simply converts the pointer type.
 * reinterpret_cast is a very special and dangerous type of casting operator
 * It is used when we want to work with bits.
 * If we use this type of cast then it becomes a non-portable product. So, it is suggested not to use this concept unless required.
 * It is only used to typecast any pointer to its original type.
