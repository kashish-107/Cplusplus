/*
 * In C++, a derived class object can be assigned to a base class object, but the other way is not possible
 * Object slicing happens when a derived class object is assigned to a base class object, additional attributes of a derived class object are sliced off to form the base class object
 * Object slicing doesnâ€™t occur when pointers or references to objects are passed as function arguments since a pointer or reference of any type takes same amount of memory
 * Object slicing can be prevented by making the base class function pure virtual there by disallowing object creation. It is not possible to create the object of a class which contains a pure virtual method.
